# Python-notes

This repo contains all of my personal notes (code-only) of **Introduction to CS using Python 6.100L** course by MIT open-course-ware.

The last few lectures of this course (from 20, to 26) were more focused towards computer science and hence theory weighted, that's the reason why you won't find any notes for them.

It has been an amazing journey following this course, it taught me a lot. Now, onto the next one.
